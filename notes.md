# Notes on the book

## TDD patterns

* Tests should be isolated, shouldn't matter what order you run them in.
* Make a list of tests and refactorings. But don't try to fix them all at once.
* When writing a test write the assertion first and work backwards.
* Use test data that makes tests easy to read and follow.

* Get to a green state as fast as possible, then refactor.
* Write the test that you can do, move one step at a time.
* When working alone ending on a broken test can help you pick up the thread next time.
